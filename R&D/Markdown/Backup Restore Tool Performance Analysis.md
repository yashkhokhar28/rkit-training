# **Backup and Restore Tool Performance Analysis**

## **Setup**

- Created a console application that generates **N** number of databases.
- For this test, a database named **test_db_1** was created, which contained **100 tables**, named `orders_1` to `orders_100`.
- Each table contained **128,975 records**.
- Size of each tableâ€™s **.ibd file** was approximately **88 MB**.
- Total size of all **.ibd files** in the **test_db_1** folder was approximately **8.59 GB** on disk.

## **Test with MySQL Workbench**

### **1. Export Process**

- Export started at **12:46:30**.
- Export completed at **12:52:25**.
- **Total export time:** **6 minutes and 5 seconds**.
- **Dump file size:** **7.31 GB**.

### **2. Import Process**

- Import started at **14:49:09**.
- Import completed at **15:08:08**.
- **Total import time:** **18 minutes and 59 seconds**.

## **Test with HeidiSQL**

### **1. Export Process**

- **Total export time:** **24 minutes**.
- **Export file size:** **12.5 GB**.

### **2. Import Process**

- Import process in HeidiSQL was **not feasible**. The file had to be loaded into the query editor and then executed.
- After **1.5 hours**, the file still didn't load properly, indicating a significant issue with HeidiSQL's import handling for large files.

## **Conclusion**

- **Percona XtraBackup outperformed all other tools**, achieving a **backup time of just 46 seconds** and a **restore time of 40 seconds**, making it the fastest method tested.
- **mysqldump (CLI) performed well**, completing the entire process in **22 minutes**, making it the **most efficient logical backup option**.
- **MySQL Workbench performed acceptably**, completing the process in **25 minutes and 4 seconds**.
- **HeidiSQL was not feasible** for large imports due to its inability to handle large SQL files efficiently.
