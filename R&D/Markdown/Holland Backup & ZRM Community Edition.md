## **4. Limitations of Holland Backup & ZRM Community Edition**

### **Holland Backup - Limitations**

1. **Primarily for MySQL** – Limited support for other databases.
2. **Command-Line Based** – Lacks a **graphical user interface (GUI)**.
3. **No Built-in Encryption** – Requires external tools for **data encryption**.
4. **Limited Community Support** – No official support; depends on **community forums**.
5. **No Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)** – Does not support **binary log backups**.
6. **Performance Concerns for Large Databases** – Logical backups (`mysqldump`) can be slow.
7. **No Native Remote Storage Support** – Requires manual configuration for **offsite backups**.

### **ZRM Community Edition - Limitations**

1. **MySQL-Specific** – Does not support other databases like **PostgreSQL or MongoDB**.
2. **LVM Setup Required** – Needs **pre-configured LVM** for raw backups.
3. **No GUI** – Fully **command-line-based**, making it difficult for non-technical users.
4. **Limited Community Support** – No **enterprise-level support** unless using the **paid version**.
5. **Not Cloud-Integrated** – Lacks native support for **AWS, GCP, or Azure** storage.
6. **Backup Overhead on Large Databases** – Mysqldump-based backups can impact **database performance**.
7. **Complex Configuration** – PITR, encryption, and compression require **manual setup**.
