### **1. Clone the Repository**

Use SSH to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git@github.com:yashkhokhar28/rkit-training.git
```

### **2. Create a Branch**

Each team member should create their own branch named after them or based on the feature they are working on. For example, if your name is "John", you might create a branch called `john-feature`.

```bash
cd repo-name
git checkout -b john-feature
```

Replace `john-feature` with whatever branch name you choose.

### **3. Push the Branch to GitHub**

Push the new branch to the remote repository on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin john-feature
```

This command pushes your local branch (`john-feature`) to the remote repository on GitHub.

### **4. Make Changes and Commit**

Work on your project, making changes and committing them to your branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
```

### **5. Push Updates**

After committing changes, push your updates to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin john-feature
```
