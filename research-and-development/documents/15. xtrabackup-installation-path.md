When you install a `.deb` package like `percona-xtrabackup-80_8.0.27-19-1.focal_amd64.deb`, it **doesn't create one single directory** where everything goes. Instead, it places files into **standard system directories**, following the **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)**. These files are scattered across logical paths depending on their purpose.

### So no, it’s not one single directory. Here's how it typically breaks down:

| Type of File        | Likely Directory                        | Example                              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Executable binaries | `/usr/bin/`                             | `/usr/bin/xtrabackup`                |
| Libraries           | `/usr/lib/`                             | Library dependencies                 |
| Documentation       | `/usr/share/doc/percona-xtrabackup-80/` | README, changelog, etc.              |
| Man pages           | `/usr/share/man/man1/`                  | Manual entries like `man xtrabackup` |

### To **see exactly which files were installed** and where:

```bash
dpkg -L percona-xtrabackup-80
```

This shows you **all installed paths**, even though there is no single “percona-xtrabackup” folder that holds everything.

---

### **Executables (tools you can run):**

These are all located in `/usr/bin/` and are **executable binaries**:

- `/usr/bin/xtrabackup` → the main backup tool
- `/usr/bin/xbstream` → used for streaming backup data
- `/usr/bin/xbcrypt` → for encrypting/decrypting backups
- `/usr/bin/xbcloud`, `/usr/bin/xbcloud_osenv` → for cloud storage support (e.g., S3)

You can run any of these from the terminal directly:

```bash
xtrabackup --help
xbstream --help
```

---

### **Libraries:**

- `/usr/lib/` and `/usr/lib/private/` contain internal static (`.a`) and shared (`.so`) libraries.
- `/usr/lib/xtrabackup/plugin/` includes optional keyring plugins like:

  - `keyring_file.so`
  - `keyring_vault.so`
  - `component_keyring_kmip.so`

These are used for advanced functionality like secure key management.

---

### **Headers:**

- `/usr/include/kmip.h` and `/usr/include/kmippp.h`
  These are **development headers**, useful only if you're compiling software that integrates with the key management plugins.

---

### **Documentation:**

- `/usr/share/doc/percona-xtrabackup-80/`
  Contains:

  - `LICENSE.gz`
  - `changelog.Debian.gz`
  - `copyright`

You can view them using `zless` or `zcat`:

```bash
zless /usr/share/doc/percona-xtrabackup-80/changelog.Debian.gz
```

---

### **Manual Pages (man pages):**

Located in `/usr/share/man/man1/` — these are accessible with:

```bash
man xtrabackup
man xbstream
```
