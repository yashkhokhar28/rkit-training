### üîç Step 1: Verify the Existing Symbolic Link

First, let's check where the existing symbolic link points:

```bash
ls -l /usr/local/bin/xtrabackup-8.4.0
```

If the output shows that the link points to a non-existent file (e.g., `/opt/percona-xtrabackup-8.4.0-2/bin/xtrabackup`), we need to correct it.

---

### üßπ Step 2: Remove the Incorrect Symbolic Link

To remove the existing (and possibly incorrect) symbolic link:

```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/xtrabackup-8.4.0
```

---

### üîç Step 3: Identify the Correct Installation Directory

After extracting the tarball, the directory name might differ slightly. Let's list the contents of the `/opt` directory to identify the correct path:

```bash
ls /opt
```

Look for a directory that starts with `percona-xtrabackup-8.4.0-2`. For example, it might be named `percona-xtrabackup-8.4.0-2-Linux-x86_64.glibc2.31` or similar.

---

### üîó Step 4: Create a New Symbolic Link

Once you've identified the correct directory, create a new symbolic link:

```bash
sudo ln -s /opt/<correct-directory>/bin/xtrabackup /usr/local/bin/xtrabackup-8.4.0
```

Replace `<correct-directory>` with the actual directory name you found in the previous step.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Verify the Installation

Now, check if the `xtrabackup-8.4.0` command works:

```bash
xtrabackup-8.4.0 --version
```

You should see output indicating the version of Percona XtraBackup installed.

---

If you continue to experience issues, please provide the output of the following commands:

```bash
ls -l /usr/local/bin/xtrabackup-8.4.0
ls /opt
```

You've successfully installed both Percona XtraBackup 8.0.27 and 8.4.0 on your system. The outputs confirm that both versions are operational:

- `xtrabackup` points to version 8.0.27.
- `xtrabackup-8.4.0` points to version 8.4.0.([Percona Documentation][1])

This setup allows you to use both versions independently, which is particularly useful when dealing with different MySQL server versions.

---

### üß™ Testing the Setup

To ensure both versions function correctly:

1. **Check Versions:**

   ```bash
   xtrabackup --version
   xtrabackup-8.4.0 --version
   ```

   The outputs should display the respective versions.

2. **Perform a Test Backup with Each Version:**

   - **Using XtraBackup 8.0.27:**

     ```bash
     xtrabackup --backup --target-dir=/tmp/backup-8.0.27
     ```

   - **Using XtraBackup 8.4.0:**

     ```bash
     xtrabackup-8.4.0 --backup --target-dir=/tmp/backup-8.4.0
     ```

   Ensure that each backup completes without errors.

3. **Restore from Backup:**

   - **Prepare the Backup:**

     ```bash
     xtrabackup-8.4.0 --prepare --target-dir=/tmp/backup-8.0.27
     ```

   - **Restore the Backup:**

     ```bash
     xtrabackup-8.4.0 --copy-back --target-dir=/tmp/backup-8.0.27
     ```

   Ensure that the restore process completes successfully.

### üîÑ Switching Between Versions

If you need to switch the default `xtrabackup` command to point to version 8.4.0, you can update the symbolic link:

```bash
sudo ln -sf /opt/percona-xtrabackup-8.4.0-2/bin/xtrabackup /usr/local/bin/xtrabackup
```

This command forces the symbolic link to point to the 8.4.0 binary.
